        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>
          I'm Enrique Ortiz. Nice to meet you! I'm a{' '}
          <SafeLink href="https://github.com/evalir">
            Software Developer
          </SafeLink>
          , Musician and occasional skater and photographer living in the
          Dominican Republic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy experimenting with and learning new things constantlyâ€”those
          are the things I'd say I do somewhat well, at least. These involve
          mainly web technologies. It's sort of what I do at my day job at
          Aragon One: I work with design and product to launch experiments and
          drive product initiatives to find PMF in the Blockchain (Ethereum)
          space. I also do Frontend Engineering (and all things javascript, for
          that matter), to improve and maintain our already existing products.
        </p>

        <p>
          When not at my day job, I like listening, collecting and making music.
          I play guitar and bass, and I'm a huge fan of artists like Enya, Tycho
          and Judas Priest. My "artist" name is{' '}
          <SafeLink href="https://evalir.bandcamp.com/">Evalir</SafeLink>, which
          has also become my username on the internet for, well, pretty much
          everything?
        </p>

        <p>
          I also really like being outdoors, doing extreme sports, reading, and
          doing whatever random and interesting thing comes up at the time. It's
          all about having fun, and learning throughout the way.
