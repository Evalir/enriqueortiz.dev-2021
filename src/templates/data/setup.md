My setup will change over the years. This is the first iteration of this section that I hope to update for a long time. This means that if you read this, you're early. Yay! Buckle up, as this might get a bit nerdy.

## Every Day Carry

Things that are with me at all times.

- iPhone 12 Pro, black (with the red leather case).
- Airpods Pro.
- Wallet, mainly with cards. Maybe cash.
- Keys.

I also sometimes carry:

- My iPad Pro, with its Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. It's where I write, so I call it my "typewritter". Include chargers if I'll be gone a long time.
- Apple Watch and Airpods Pro pluggable chargers.
- My Macbook Pro, 2018 15-inch if I'm working from some other place that isn't my home.

## Hardware

I tinker with a lot of different things, even if I only really use my laptop to program. I take stuff such as music, or 3d design to justify owning a bit more hardware.

- LG Ultrawide 34-inch monitor QHD. Really great for design, especially.
- DAS Keyboard Ultimate with blank keycaps and brown switches. My biggest flex, really.
- Shitty MMORPG mouse with like 18 buttons. Comes from a time where I played too much World Of Warcraft and Arma 2 / DayZ, and got used to having a ton of shortcuts on my right hand.
- I also own some Audio Technica ATH-M20X headphones. They're the best I've ever had and I had the lower-tier model for like 5 years until they broke. This pair has been going for 3 years already. If they break, I'll invest in a wireless pair for travel.

## Development

Given that I've learned most of what I know from people that advocate for the open source movement and the world wide web, most of my tools are from that domain as well. I enjoy having tools tailored especially to me, as I spend most of my days inside them. Even though I'm not a "code janitor" by any means, I try to invest in my tools as much as possible.

- I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as a text editor. I previously used VS Code, but its sluggishness due to being a heavy electron application made me consider a switch to Vim seriously. After going through my main [mentor's guide](https://github.com/bpierre/switch-to-vim-for-good), I made the switch, and could not be happier. I was not a keybindings guy, but Vim changed my mind.
- I use [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) to manage my multiple sessions. I have a tendency to look at other projects and recall past code for reference, and tmux serves the purpose really well. Combined with Neovim, it's a really dangerous, high-speed coding combo which helps me lock into flow state.
- I use Firefox, both the normal and developer edition to test what I do. I'll switch to Safari and Chrome once in a while to see how certain things, like focus states and not-so-well supported styles look from time to time as well. I'd encourage you to use Firefox mainly, though. :)
- My terminal is Alacritty, which is not acting very well with Big Sur. I don't like the other options though, so I'm staying with it.
- My shell is ZSH, of course.

Here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Evalir/dotfiles), if you wanna see. Sorry for the mess!

## Design and Photography

- Figma is where all things design live, of course. It's a great tool, and the one I like the most.
- Blender, Spline for 3d work, which I should do more of.
- I edit my photos primarily with Darkroom.

## Writing

The iPad Pro is my go to. Is way more enjoyable and feels more natural. Of course, whatever will do the job, so it's mostly a matter of taste. Everything lives in Notion.

## Photo

I have a Sony 5100 that I take pictures with. I have some lenses to buy, but as it was meant to be a "travel" purchase I delayed ordering them, because, well, COVID. My iPhone takes greats photos as well.

## Software

I'd love to introduce more open source software to this list, but there's a convenience factor I don't want to compromise on for now. Here's what gets me through the day.

- Todoist is my task dump. Keeps me organized and focused.
- Notion is my knowledge base, second brain, and writing studio.
- 1Password keeps me safe.
- Raycast lets me fly around my computer really fast. Check them out.
- Hey is where my personal email gets redirected to. For my other addresses I use Spark.

## Services

- Spotify for music. Fun fact: I signed up for it the same day they became available at the Dominican Republic, around 7 years ago. That was the first time email was useful for me.
- Buttondown is what I use for my newsletter, unscripted. Check it out!
- I, of course, have iCloud as I'm in the Apple ecosystem.
