title: 'Three JS, Blender and Bundlers'

After two weeks of intense out-of-my-bubble backend coding for work, I can finally dive into browser stuff again 💆‍♂️. This means I'll probably be messing with Vite as I wanted to tried since some time ago with one of our js libs. I'll also be watching Bruno Simon's course on Three JS, which also gives me an excuse to play more with blender. As you can see, I'm a pro in filling up my weekend with stuff to do (unnecesarily).
