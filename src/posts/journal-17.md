The SendGrid docs are really really bad. Like, for real. The documentation for their node package is outdated, and it turns out they have a "newer" API—whose documentation is living in their website, completely separate from their node package. All of this made me spend over 2 hours doing a very simple task, which should've been at most 30 mins, which is really annoying to me. But sh\*t happens from time to time.

Also, this page now has an RSS feed. You can subscribe to it using your favorite reader. The content's at `/rss.xml`. I'll find a nicer way to show it's available on the page later. I've also been thinking of ways to be able to just add journal entries from a page—markdown is nice but I'd love to use my iPad for writing these and having to go through the manual Notion -> .md file process. I'll probably figure that out later though (I might just build a script).
