It's been a hectic work day, mainly due to the copious amount of coding I've done. There's also been a ton of organizational work in terms of setting up boards, Notion pages and such on the job. While in an engineering role coding feels like the *only* productive thing to do, turns out planning is just as important—and probably even more exhausting—as is banging out line after line of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I just saw something super interesting though, which is what prompted me to write this. It's called [Hey, World](https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e) and it's of course done by the guys at Basecamp. I absolutely _adore_ the idea and probably might cross-post all of my stuff there, but we first have to see if they follow through, which I hope they do. I've found a few microblogging platforms over the past few weeks, but I'm particularly digging this one as it seems different, privacy focused (due to how Hey works), and to the point.
