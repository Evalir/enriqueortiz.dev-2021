It's been almost a month since my last post. While it's definitely been a long time without journaling, I've been working on releasing something at work, which I'm glad is now pretty much there. This is a normal thing for me: when it's time to get my head down and work something, everything else gets filtered out. I don't know if it's being bad at dividing my time, "hyperfocus", or whatnot, but it's both a blessing and a curse.

I've also been doing some cool open source stuff recently, which might turn into a nice little project to maintain. I have more ideas to make as well, so probably after this release settles down I might go into maker mode. The only thing that I need to kickstart this is a trip though, because honestly I'm tired of being at home.
