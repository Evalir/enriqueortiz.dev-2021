Due to an unfortunate health situation in my family, I've moved again where I was living before the pandemic happened. It's arguably a better/nicer place, but moving itself, sucks quite a bunch. Hopefully, the next time I move, it's due to better news.

On the other side, I've decided to live in Linux for a some time as my Macbook's keyboard has decided to slowly die, key by key. I now own a Lenovo Thinkpad, and it's quite a good piece of machinery; the only thing I'd criticise is the trackpad, which is absolute crap, even though I haven't found a good one that is not made by Apple. I'll be definitely switching to macOS again, but that'll happen after the 16 inch models with the M1 chip are released.
